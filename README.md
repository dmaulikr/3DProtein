# 3DProtein
An android 3D Game to help to solve the protein folding
# Project Introduction
# 3DProtein
3D Protein folding is a puzzle game which users play to help researchers solve protein folding problems. The game itself is played in a three-dimensional environment with regularly- shaped blocks which represent structural elements of proteins whose folds have not been solved. When users solve the puzzle, they are also solving the structure of the protein in question; averages of the solutions provided by many users could then be used to give researchers an idea of the structure of the protein. Structural information about proteins is invaluable to researchers in a variety of fields, as protein structure is inherently linked to function. Therefore a complete understanding of a proteinâ€™s function requires precise knowledge of its structure.
Proteins have a range of functions with medical, industrial, and fundamental implications which make them interesting . A powerful example is the HIV protease protein, whose function was known for many years, but whose structure remained a mystery since its discovery. When the citizen science game FoldIt allowed users to solve the structure, they did so in just three weeks[3]. The protein is now a drug target for treating HIV infection; an understanding of its structure was the key piece which prevented this from happening. PeptiBlocks aims to follow FoldIt with a simpler, mobile-based game that a broad audience would enjoy playing without having to understand the intricate chemistry involved in protein structure determination.
